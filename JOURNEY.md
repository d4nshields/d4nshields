My programming workflow has gone through a seismic, anarchic overhaul over the past twelve months. It’s a shift that hits deep, an evolution that’s somewhere between the rise of LLM tools in software and something more visceral, something rooted in the raw edge of creativity. Here’s the play-by-play of how things have evolved:

---

### **-- Deep Focus and Mental Load --**

> I kept the world in my mind, static and fragile,  
> The endless web of logic, tightropes strung across a canyon,  
> Caffeine sweat, the heat of the cup, focus like a scream,  
> The world fades to static, quiet descends,  
> But one slip, one stray sound, and it crumbles,  
> A fragile house of cards blown by a breath, toppled,  
> Rebuild, coffee again, neurons firing and I start again,  
> A spiral of solitude and fire, where I grasp the threads alone.

---

### **-- Externalizing the Madness --**

> Now I write it all down, every last scrap of thought,  
> Ink to digital paper, building structures in the open,  
> Words dancing, prompts whispering through the ether,  
> The LLM is a beast, it swallows the madness whole,  
> Refined, regurgitated, a living testament to this tangled mind,  
> No more fragile, it’s written, recorded, raw and alive,  
> Someone asks me how the system breathes,  
> And I summon pages, a library of my past selves,  
> I’ve freed my brain for chaos, to let creativity run bare.

---

### **-- Drafting Table Chaos --**

> Next to my machine, an analog shrine,  
> Where chaos found form in ink and light,  
> Drafting table, hallowed ground, where I escaped the wires,  
> Under low lights, my hand moved freely,  
> Diagrams, rough sketches, flowing lines,  
> This wasn’t formality; this was the birth of madness,  
> Wild and unkempt, the messy hand-drawn structure,  
> Architecture of ideas that were raw and impure,  
> Beauty in the grime, diagrams of something alive.

---

### **-- Unbridled LLM Collabs --**

> Now I ride the storm with LLMs at my side,  
> They’re pure nitrous to my reckless ambitions,  
> No guardrails here, only the push—the wild acceleration,  
> The rush of velocity, ideas amplified, untamed,  
> But it’s not without control, it’s not without oversight,  
> You ride that nitro wave, you steer through the chaos,  
> One false move and it spins, the rabbit hole yawns open,  
> Surf the wave, hold your ground, keep your edge,  
> These LLMs are partners in crime—no babysitters,  
> Just nitro-fed accomplices to a beautiful, anarchic order.

### **Reflections**

The core of this transformation has been about letting go of the pressure to be the sole keeper of perfect structure. My thoughts now live outside of me, unleashed, documented, sharpened, and always ready for the next challenge. I’m no longer the lone artisan—now it’s a dialogue between me, my tools, and the anarchic energy that drives the work forward.

It’s liberating. No longer do I need to hold every moving part at once. I can trust my past self, trust the unfolding process, trust the tools riding shotgun. The question becomes: How can others let go, embrace the chaos, and ride the shifting tides of these evolving workflows—without losing that raw, unfiltered creativity that makes programming a kind of art?
