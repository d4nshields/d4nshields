### About me

I'm a multifaceted developer and advocate with a passion for building comprehensive solutions. My expertise includes front-end, back-end, database design, machine learning, and architecture. I thrive on collaboration and knowledge sharing. Outside of work, I stay active through running, cycling, rowing, swimming, hiking, and walking my furry friends.
