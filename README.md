### About me

I'm a versatile full-stack developer with a passion for building well-rounded solutions. My expertise spans front-end development, back-end services, database design, and solution architecture. As a developer advocate, I thrive on collaboration and knowledge sharing. Outside of work, I find balance through staying active. Whether it's running, swimming, hitting the trails, or walking furry companions, I'm always up for an adventure.
