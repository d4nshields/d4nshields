### About me

I'm a technology enthusiast dedicated to helping others harness the power of technology to transform and enrich their lives. With expertise spanning front-end, back-end, database design, machine learning, and architecture, I thrive on collaboration and knowledge sharing. Outside of work, I stay active through running, cycling, swimming, rowing, hiking, and walking my furry friends.
