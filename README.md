I'm a technology enthusiast dedicated to helping others harness the power of technology to transform and enrich their lives. With a proven track record in delivering and maintaining major mobile products, I bring deep expertise in mobile development, databases, machine learning, and software architecture. I thrive on collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I'm passionate about conceptualizing innovative ideas and turning startups into realities. Outside of work, I stay active through running, cycling, swimming, rowing, hiking, and walking my furry friends.
