### About me

I’m Dan, someone who finds balance by bridging technology and nature, connecting the two on nature's terms. Outside the digital realm, I find myself drawn to the water—dragon boating, kayaking, and canoeing—all pursuits that demand focus and give back a sense of calm.

My mornings start with a run, ending just as dawn breaks, when I take a few quiet moments for meditation. And in the evenings, I enjoy catching sight of the moon, whether it’s beside me at sunset or illuminating a late walk. These small rituals keep me grounded, a steady backdrop to my life.

In my work, I’m driven by an eternal quest for knowledge and for ways to connect—whether it’s people, ideas, or technology. I thrive on exploring new paths and pushing boundaries, believing there’s always more to learn, another question to ask, and a new connection waiting to be made.
